# PideCola
Problem: The USB (Universidad Simón Bolívar) has a huge problem with the transportation of its students. The installations are far away from the city and because of the actual Venezuelan crisis, there is no enough public transportation. In the other hand, the USB's private transportation isn't working properly because there are funds to maintain the vehicles and drivers. All this leads to a great amount of students that can't get or leave the installations, but luckily, in the spirit of community the student association organized "Pide Cola", an initiative that asks to students with vehicles to help others with a ride. "Pide Cola" has helped a lot of students, but at the moment is chaotic and unorganized.

We aim to create a system that helps organizing the "Pide Cola" initiative, making it faster and more efective for all the students.

Note: This is an university project of the Systems and Project Analysis subject of IPCA
